# ARMSTRONG

Armstrong is a functional electrical stimulation (FES) project aimed to help individuals with spinal chord injuries. The loss of dexterity in the fingers and hand makes day-to-day life much more difficult. The wearable watch has two electrodes that are placed on the user's arm to stimulate the forearm muscles which elicits a grasping motion.

The project contains two PCB designs located in
/ArmstrongPCB/
for a transformer based stimulation circuit and also a boost/H-bridge based stimulation circuit for more waveform options and amplitude.

The project also contains the firmware located in
/ArmstrongSoftware/
which can be flashed to an Arduino. There is separate firmware for the transformer based circuit and the boost/H-bridge based circuit.
